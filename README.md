# JavaScript-HTML-Comparing-Two-Inputs-With-Return
I've added something to the submit button. I went in and I added a onclick="return check();". So there's something new that you haven't seen before. It's the idea of the return value. And it says hey, don't just run this function, I need to know did it return true or false. Then, I went over here and I added an additional line of code to our JavaScript. It says go ahead check all the same things and still do that alert, but in addition, after the person hits okay I need you to return false. So for you only to be returning things two times, we'll run this function it'll go through says they didn't match, I'm gonna return the word false over here. And whenever input type sees a false it knows I've gotta stop. I'm not allowed to do what it is I'm trying to do.
